## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

One of the things many find sorely lacking in the Bioware NPCs are the more complex relationships presented by modern NPC mods--especially in regards to "friendships," the relationships NPCs have with the PC when not romancing them.

This mod adds a series of dialogues with Haer'dalis.


Visit the <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/npciep">website</a> or <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/index.php?showforum=643">forum</a> for all the latest updates.

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA) with the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE), the conversion projects Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT) and Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).

The Haer'dalis Friendship mod should be compatible with all WeiDU mods, however, we cannot test every single one. It is only compatible with BGII: ToB. If you do encounter an error, please let us know by posting the message at our forums.

>Although it is not required for the Haer'dalis Friendship to function properly, it is always a good idea to install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a>.

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

<em>If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-haerdalis_friendship.exe`**, un-install the previously installed main component and delete the :file_folder: haerdalis_friendship folder.</em>

<em>When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.</em>

**Disable any antivirus** or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: haerdalis_friendship folder and a setup-haerdalis_friendship.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-haerdalis_friendship.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-haerdalis_friendship.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change the component settings.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-haerdalis_friendship --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>

## <a name="faq" id="faq"></a>Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is the Haer'dalis Friendship compatible with XYZ mod?**  
A: It most certainly should be, but we have not tested it with every single mod available. If you do encounter an error, please contact K'aeloree (kae@spellholdstudios.net) or alternatively post on the <a href="http://www.shsforums.net">forums</a>.

**Q: Is it compatible with Aeryn's Haer'dalis romance?**  
A: Yes, as there are significant similarities between the two mods. Depending on where you break off your romance with Haer'dalis, the friendship will immediately begin at the appropriate point in the track.

**Q: When will the friendship start?**  
A: It should begin a half an hour after completing the Planar Prison quest.

**Q: This mod isn't in character at *all*.**  
A: We're always looking for ways to improve the characterisation in this mod, so please post any suggestions or constructive criticism on the <a href="http://www.shsforums.net">forums</a>.

**Q: Have you got any plans to expand the mod by adding more dialogues in future?**  
A: There are no current plans to add to the mod, no, but feel free to make suggestions!

**Q: How many dialogues are there added in total?**  
A: There are a total of 20 new dialogues added by the mod, 15 in SoA and 5 in ToB. Some of these do have particular circumstances in which they occur--for more information feel free to ask on the forum.

**Q: Does this mod change the game in any way besides adding more dialogue to Haer'dalis?**  
A: No, it shouldn't.

**Q: Is there any chance that player initiated dialogue will be added in future?**  
A: There are currently no plans for it.

**Q: I would like to translate the Haer'dalis friendship into another language. Any chance you could TRAify the mod?**  
A: Sure, we'd be happy to. If you are interested in translating, just send us a line and I'll see what I can do for the next version.
